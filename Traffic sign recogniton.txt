Introduction:

In this project, I had created a deep learning model to classify a traffic sign in the image with an accuracy of 95%.

 

 

 

Explain: 

Function:- basically this project classifies name of a traffic sign by processing its images.

 

Data: I got data from Kaggle website of name german traffic sign recognition benchmark. In the dataset, I got 43 classes of images of 
traffic signs.

Here I have to first load images into number format for which I used image module of pillow package. I changed every image into a 3 
channel of 2d list each dimension for the colour value of RGB respectively, which eventually I resized to 3 channel of 30 * 30 format 
which further I changed into categorical form.



 

Tools and technologies:-

pillow,OpenCV, TensorFlow,Keras, etc.

 

At last, I made a sequential model of neural networks. I trained the model on the numpy array that I had created before.
 

I had spent across 5 days to build this project.
 

In future, I am going to make this model work on live camera as it sees a sign in camera feed it makes a rectangle on it and 
specify its name. 
 

challenge:-{

I didn't changed my csv file in categorical format which makes my model inefficient as only 70% accuracy is predicting which I
 increased by converting my class in categorical form.
}
